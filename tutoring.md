# Tutoring

My name is Andrew, I recently graduated from Bristol University with a Masters in Engineering Mathematics. I decided to become a software engineer due to its demand for learning and its capabilities to impact a large number of people.

I want to help you learn the type of thinking that is required to do well in physics / maths / computing. These subjects become much easier once the confusion or missing knowledge has found, its a bit like an investigation, you are trying to put all the puzzle pieces together, once you understand it properly everything flows very well!
