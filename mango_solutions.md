### Modeller:

Circadian Rhythm, my focus on this project was mainly on the sleep detection. We were given accelerometer data obtained from the SPHERE project and were assigned to detect sleep. This was considered an unsupervised classification. By the end of the project we managed to implement a centroid based clustering algorithm known as k-means. Evaluation for the performance of the k-means algorithm was difficult since the data given was unlabelled. 

This project was relevant to health, home automation and many other companies that want to understand human sleep patterns. The project involved multiple stages; data preprocessing, feature extraction, machine learning implementation and evaluation of the model.

Tools used: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib.

The code can be seen below:

### Datawrangler:
For my cloud computing course (this term), I will be self-teaching myself Django, NOSQL for developing a blink detection web app that the user can upload multiple images and outputs the best photo based on your eyes. Deployed on a cloud service. 

### Technologist:
Web tech: HTML, Javascript, CSS, Django (this term) and NoSQL (this term).

### Note:
I will be taking a data science course in 2018 to gain relevant knowledge to solve business challenges using data after graduation. [course unit](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/unit-programme-catalogue/UnitDetails.jsa?unitCode=COMSM0017)

### Motivation to join Mango Solution:
I hope to join Mango Solution to get the opportunity to solve a broad and varied set of problems using data driven approaches. While obtaining invaluable experience in professional communication and presentations.
