### Commercial Software Experience 

**Miminal's blog website**:

> Gained experience with the entire software life cycle excluding deployment; from tech review to creation of the website.
The project exposed me to a lot of different technologies and gained front end experience.

**Concepts used: Mobile responsive design, tech stack review, front-end development.**
**Technolgies used: Hexo.js, SASS, Pug.js, Bootstrap4** .

**Miminal's client (KADlytics)**:
> Developed visualisations from AI analytics for communicating to project managers. I also worked on backend development; Creating schemas, building a pipeline for inserting data into the MongoDB web app database, and passing the inserted data into visualisations.

**Concepts used: AI analytics Visualisations, component-based paradigm (with React), schemas, Database insertion and querying using REST API**. 

**Technologies used: React & Ant Design, and MongoDB (a noSQL database)**.

### Data Engineering

Movie Credits Project:

> Movie credits, my focus on this project was data cleaning, and extraction of the relevant information to the task. In summary, it required data filtering, data manipulation and data formatting to create an adjacency matrix for enabling analysis with network theory . 

**Concepts used: Data engineering with Python, Object-oriented Programming**.

This project was heavily a programming problem so here is a collection of the scripts that I wrote for this project:

### Team Player
> "Andrew quickly became a valuable member of our team, settling in easily and making improvements to our development processes. He is a self-motivated individual that took responsibility of tasks and kept other team members updated with his progress. He was never afraid to ask for help, but always attempted (and mostly succeeded) to research and implement a solution before asking others. Andrew put forward a number of excellent ideas during his time with us about product development and our processes, all of which have now been implemented in the business and have shown to have a positive impact on our output."

### Attention to detail
I am a person who learns concepts through fundamentals and methodical thinking, in addition to my interest in product delivery with software, I believe this will make me well suited to testing role and provide a unique perspective as a junior tester.
