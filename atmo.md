Dear Sir / Madam,

This is a covering letter to apply for your software development role at Atmo in Bristol. 

### Machine Learning Knowledge

Final year project:
* Implemented and adapted a Twitter text tokenizer for detecting tokens that are unique to Twitter messages.
* Filtered out tokens that appear to often using TF-IDF algorithm and building a Feature set.
* Applied the feature set to convert Twitter messages into a vector.
* Applied Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithm to the processed labelled data to carry out a comparison of the models.
* Deployed the best performing ML algorithm on a Flask webserver so it could be used on a web application that pulls messages from Twitter user timelines.

Statistical Pattern Recognition Course:

Learned about the mathematical background behind ML algorithms which includes: Perceptron, Support Vector Machines, Least Squares, Nearest Neighbour, K-means, Principal Component Analysis.

### Data science

Circadian Rhythm Project:

> Circadian Rhythm, my focus on this project was mainly on the sleep detection. We were given accelerometer data obtained from the SPHERE project and were assigned to detect sleep. This was considered an unsupervised classification. By the end of the project we managed to implement a centroid based clustering algorithm known as k-means. Evaluation for the performance of the k-means algorithm was difficult since the data given was unlabelled. This project was relevant to health, home
automation and many other companies that want to understand human sleep patterns. 

The project involved multiple stages: data preprocessing, feature extraction, machine learning implementation and evaluation of the model.

Tools used: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib.

The code can be seen below:

Movie Credits Project:

Movie credits, my focus on this project was data cleaning, and extraction of the relevant information to the task. In summary, it required data filtering, data manipulation and data formatting. This project was heavily a programming problem so here is a collection of the scripts that I wrote personally for this project:

### Technical Data science skills
* Database: MongoDB
* Data Processing and cleaning: Pandas, Numpy
* Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn
* Data Visualisation: Matplotlib, React.js(BizCharts)

### Team Player
> "Andrew quickly became a valuable member of our team, settling in easily and making improvements to our development processes. He is a self-motivated individual that took responsibility of tasks and kept other team members updated with his progress. He was never afraid to ask for help, but always attempted (and mostly succeeded) to research and implement a solution before asking others. Andrew put forward a number of excellent ideas during his time with us about product development and our processes, all of which have now been implemented in the business and have shown to have a positive impact on our output."

### Motivation to join Atmo

In my last internship I spent some time designing software that would help communicate complex information to managers simply. I believe this is important to delivering business value.

Working at Atmo will give me the opportunity help clients with their operations and health & safety through data-driven technology.
Futhermore it will help me with gaining more commercial data science and software development experience. 

Thank you for reading this covering letter,
I look forward to hearing from you.
