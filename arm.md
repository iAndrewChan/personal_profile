### Masters Project
My masters project is focused on **centroid-based clustering algorithms for analysing social media data**. The aim is to speed up clustering algorithms to help tackle the common problem that all clustering algorithms typically face; inefficienies in handling very large datasets.
The project is still in its early stages; there are two possible avenues to explore so far. Hash functions and Complex Network analysis. The common theme between these two approaches is to reduce the clustering search space for the clustering algorithm.
The possible approaches may change over the coming weeks but the underlying aim will not.

### Modelling:

Circadian Rhythm, my focus on this project was mainly on the sleep detection. We were given accelerometer data obtained from the SPHERE project and were assigned to detect sleep. This was considered an unsupervised classification. By the end of the project we managed to implement a centroid based clustering algorithm known as k-means. Evaluation for the performance of the k-means algorithm was difficult since the data given was unlabelled. 

This project was relevant to health, home automation and many other companies that want to understand human sleep patterns. The project involved multiple stages; data preprocessing, feature extraction, machine learning implementation and evaluation of the model.

Tools used: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib.

The code can be seen below:

Movie credits, my focus on this project was **data cleaning, and extraction of the relevant information to the task**. In summary, it required data filtering, data manipulation and data formatting. This project was heavily a programming problem so here is a collection of the scripts that I wrote personally for this project:

Movie Credits showcases my current level of experience with Python.

### Database:
For my cloud computing course (this term), I will be self-teaching myself Django and NOSQL for developing a blink detection web app deployed on a cloud service. The idea is so that a user can upload multiple selfies and it will output the best photo based on your eyes. [Course Unit](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/unit-programme-catalogue/UnitDetails.jsa?unitCode=COMSM0010)

### Technologist:
Web tech: HTML, Javascript, CSS, Django (this term) and NoSQL (this term).

### Note:
I will be taking a data science course in 2018 to gain relevant knowledge to solve business challenges using data after graduation. [Course Unit](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/unit-programme-catalogue/UnitDetails.jsa?unitCode=COMSM0017)

### Motivation to join ARM:
By joining ARM I hope to expose myself and learn new technologies. I wish to improve my skills gained from University so far.
