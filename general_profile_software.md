> Movie credits, my focus on this project was data cleaning, and extraction of the relevant information to the task. In summary, it required data filtering, data manipulation and data formatting to create an adjacency matrix for enabling analysis with network theory . 

**Concepts used: Data engineering with Python, Object-oriented Programming**.

This project was heavily a programming problem so here is a collection of the scripts that I wrote for this project:

### Team Player
> "Andrew quickly became a valuable member of our team, settling in easily and making improvements to our development processes. He is a self-motivated individual that took responsibility of tasks and kept other team members updated with his progress. He was never afraid to ask for help, but always attempted (and mostly succeeded) to research and implement a solution before asking others. Andrew put forward a number of excellent ideas during his time with us about product development and our processes, all of which have now been implemented in the business and have shown to have a positive impact on our output."
